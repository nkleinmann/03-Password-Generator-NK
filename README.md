# 03-Password-Generator-NK

3rd homework for UNH Coding Bootcamp: Password Generator. In this project, I was given starter HTML and CSS.  I updated index.html to include a Bootstrap grid to be more responsive.  Overall, I used JavaScript to create a random password at least 8 characters long and no more than 128 characters long.  Users have to input a valid length and choose at least one of the following options; lower case, upper case, numbers, special characters, when creating their random password.

Parts of Website:
1. User clicks on button
2. User inputs valid length
3. User chooses if they want lower case letters
4. User chooses if they want upper case letters
5. User chooses if they want numbers
6. User chooses if they want special characters

Challenges: This was my first larger project using JavaScript.  I learned a lot in debugging and researching (Google-fu), specifically on how to use randomization in JavaScript and global and local scopes.  I started with adding an event listener and making sure the first prompt worked as I wanted it to.  Then I worked on storing responses from other prompts and creating arrays which would later be used to create the larger array to choose random characters from for the password.  Console logs helped me when a part of my program was not working as expected, such as when my password was not resetting when a user tries to generate a second password.

Here is the link to my application:
